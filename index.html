          It's very exciting. You look at the negative. I look at it in a very
          positive way. I said this is the greatest opportunity this nation got.
          Never, ever, all these people, the country is unified on one thing: We
          need change.That’s precisely what version 2 means. We don't want to go
          back to the old style. Then what is the meaning of giving all these
          lives? It has no meaning because everything that we did, we destroyed
          everything. So we have to begin to build a new one.
